## ⚠️ Read Before You Mine

We’re excited to see so many people interested in Nockchain mining, including many newcomers. However, it's important to understand what mining Nockchain currently involves — and what it *does not* guarantee.

### ✅ The Reference Miner Works

Yes, the open-source reference client **does work**. It produces valid zero-knowledge proofs and has been tested extensively.

But…

### 🚨 Mining Is a Competition, Not an Airdrop

This is **Proof of Work**, and that means competition. The goal is to apply your software and hardware creativity to improve ZK proving speed and efficiency. It is **not** a simple process where everyone earns a fixed reward just by running code.

#### A. The Reference Client Is a Starting Point

It’s just that — a baseline. Everyone starts here, but using it *as-is* will not win you any $NOCKS in the current network conditions. It’s meant to be studied, optimized, extended, and re-engineered.

#### B. Mining Means Competing

Winning blocks means outperforming others. Right now, if you're using the reference miner without optimizations, your chances of successfully mining a block are **virtually zero**.

To be blunt: **you will not earn $NOCKS with the unmodified reference client** at this stage.

## 👷 What Should You Do?

We deeply appreciate the enthusiasm — we’re honored by it, truly.

But we also don’t want you to waste your time, energy, or money if you're not ready to compete.

If you’re not ready to optimize mining, consider contributing in other ways:
- Build tools around Nockchain
- Create content, visuals, or memes
- Write guides or documentation
- Explore the ecosystem creatively

The Telegram community has been hilarious, chaotic, and deeply entertaining — we love it all. Stick around if you're genuinely interested.

## 🔮 Future Opportunities

Depending on how the network evolves, new mining or participation opportunities may arise. Stay tuned.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Nockchain is intended to be the economic engine of something much larger.

If you know, you know.

If you don’t — no amount of $NOCKS will help you anyway.
